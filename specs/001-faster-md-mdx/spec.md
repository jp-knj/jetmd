# Feature Specification: faster-md & mdx

**Feature Branch**: `001-faster-md-mdx`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "faster-md & mdx: WASM-first high-performance Markdown core (Rust) with MDX compiler layer. CommonMark compliant with opt-in GFM, no ENV vars, options-based config, Node e20/ESM, monorepo structure"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Successfully parsed: high-performance Markdown/MDX processor
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: developers (actors), compile/parse/render (actions), 
     Markdown/MDX documents (data), performance/security (constraints)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clearly specified in detailed input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flows defined for Markdown and MDX processing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Requirements extracted from specification
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Document, AST nodes, compilation options identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements testable and business-focused
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer building modern web applications, I need an ultra-fast Markdown processor that can handle both standard Markdown and MDX (Markdown with JSX components), providing consistent and secure output with excellent performance characteristics. The system should work seamlessly in both Node.js and browser environments via WebAssembly, without requiring environment variables for configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CommonMark-compliant Markdown file, **When** processed through the system, **Then** it produces valid HTML output matching CommonMark 0.30 specification with e99.5% conformance

2. **Given** a Markdown file with GFM extensions enabled, **When** tables, strikethrough, or autolinks are present, **Then** they render correctly according to GFM specification

3. **Given** an MDX file with JSX components and JavaScript expressions, **When** compiled, **Then** it produces a valid ESM module that can be imported and rendered

4. **Given** a 50KB Markdown document, **When** processed in WASM mode, **Then** parsing completes in <3ms (p50) and <15ms (p99)

5. **Given** untrusted user input with potentially malicious HTML/scripts, **When** processed with default settings, **Then** all dangerous content is sanitized while preserving safe formatting

6. **Given** a large document being edited incrementally, **When** small changes are made, **Then** e90% of unchanged nodes are reused without reprocessing

7. **Given** a document with YAML frontmatter, **When** parsed, **Then** frontmatter is extracted and made available as structured data

8. **Given** custom plugin functions for syntax or transformation, **When** registered, **Then** they execute in predictable order as pure functions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when deeply nested structures exceed reasonable limits? ’ System applies configurable depth limits and fails gracefully with clear diagnostics
- How does system handle malformed MDX with unclosed JSX tags? ’ Produces clear error messages (e.g., "MDX1001: Unclosed JSX tag") with line/column information
- What happens with circular references in link definitions? ’ Detected and reported as errors during link resolution phase
- How does system handle extremely large files (>10MB)? ’ Streaming mode processes blocks incrementally, maintaining memory usage d3× input size
- What happens when conflicting plugins are registered? ’ Priority system resolves conflicts, later registrations override earlier ones

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Markdown Processing
- **FR-001**: System MUST parse CommonMark 0.30 specification with e99.5% conformance rate
- **FR-002**: System MUST support opt-in GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions (tables, strikethrough, autolinks, task lists, footnotes)
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract and parse YAML frontmatter when present at document start
- **FR-004**: System MUST support directive syntax (::name{attrs}) for extensible block/inline/leaf directives
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve source position information for all parsed elements

#### Performance Requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST achieve e200 MB/s throughput on native platforms with SIMD support
- **FR-007**: System MUST achieve e50 MB/s throughput in WebAssembly environments
- **FR-008**: System MUST process 50KB documents with <3ms median latency and <15ms p99 latency
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain memory usage d1.5× input size for typical documents, d3× for worst-case
- **FR-010**: System MUST reuse e90% of unchanged nodes during incremental parsing of small edits

#### MDX Support
- **FR-011**: System MUST parse JSX components within Markdown content
- **FR-012**: System MUST support JavaScript expressions in curly braces within MDX
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle ESM imports and exports in MDX files
- **FR-014**: System MUST compile MDX to valid ES modules with JSX output
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear diagnostics for MDX syntax errors with severity levels

#### Security & Safety
- **FR-016**: System MUST sanitize HTML output by default, removing dangerous elements and attributes
- **FR-017**: System MUST disable raw HTML pass-through by default (opt-in via allowDangerousHtml)
- **FR-018**: System MUST add security attributes to external links (rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer")
- **FR-019**: System MUST escape code blocks by default to prevent XSS
- **FR-020**: System MUST never execute code during MDX compilation phase

#### Configuration & API
- **FR-021**: System MUST accept all configuration via options objects (no environment variables)
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide synchronous and asynchronous initialization modes
- **FR-023**: System MUST support plugin registration for syntax, transform, and render hooks
- **FR-024**: System MUST allow custom slug generation with pluggable algorithms
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide multiple output formats (HTML, AST, events, source maps)

#### Integration & Compatibility
- **FR-026**: System MUST work with Node.js e20 using ES modules
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide Vite plugins for .md and .mdx files
- **FR-028**: System MUST offer compatibility bridge for mdast/hast ecosystems
- **FR-029**: System MUST provide command-line interface for file processing
- **FR-030**: System MUST support streaming output for large documents

### Key Entities

- **Markdown Document**: The input text containing CommonMark syntax, optional extensions, and metadata
- **FMDAST Node**: Abstract syntax tree representation with type, position, data, and optional children/value
- **MDX Component**: JSX element or JavaScript expression embedded in Markdown
- **Plugin Configuration**: Syntax matcher, transformer function, or renderer hook with priority and phase
- **Compilation Options**: Settings for GFM, sanitization, frontmatter, directives, slugger, and output format
- **Diagnostic Message**: Error/warning/info with code, severity, position, and human-readable description
- **Source Map**: Mapping between input positions and output positions for debugging
- **Incremental Session**: Stateful parsing context preserving unchanged nodes across edits
